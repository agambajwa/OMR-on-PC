OMR checking on a basic system
In this system OMR answer sheet will be scanned and this scanned image will be given as input to the software. By using image processing technique, one will find the answers marked by the student by finding the regions of interest and then check the answers. This is a very low-cost efficient system and also works beyond the limitations of the format by making defined manipulations.
